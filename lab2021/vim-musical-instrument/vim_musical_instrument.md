## Learning VIM is like learning to play a musical instrument
<!--- dmid="uu820vimlearn05ylink" --->

* vim is to piano as vscode is to drum machine + sequencer
* vim is to piano as FillInTheBlanksGUIapp is to spotify
* this really hit home as i was hand-creating Vim macros to manipulate docregion islands inside python code
    * gh tymac search ;; href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Adreftymac+docregion+islands&type=code" ;; dmid="uu780drumsx03xlink"

### Piano analogy (one riff at a time)
<!--- dmid="uu820tatbrx03xlink" --->

* learn to play one "riff" at a time
* start with one small "riff"
* repeat it over-and-over-and-over again until you are sick of doing it (StepXX:uu28glesku)
* save that off in your "riff snippets"
* learn another riff (one that matches with the previous or completely disjoint)
* go back to uu28glesku

### Piano analogy (first learn "keys")
<!--- dmid="uu820tatbry05ylink" --->

* learn to play major keys
* learn to play minor keys
* practice various "songs" and "chords" in those keys
* repeat over-and-over-and-over until you can consistently avoid going "off-key"
* keep building your repetoire of songs, chords in target keys
