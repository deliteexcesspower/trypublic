gui discoverability claim ;; uu7694havo03hed ;; Discoverability. CLIs are notoriously bad at discoverability. GUIs, on the other hand, are much better about showing a user what options / commands are available.
right tool for right job  ;; uu6290mezo04mos ;; both around because they are each good at specific kinds of tasks. We use CLIs to remote into servers because it doesn't require much bandwidth and it works with high latency, etc
partisanship mentality    ;; uu5969spuro9fla ;; I don't understand this mentality that people have that one tool is superior to another in all cases (e.g., linux is always better than Windows, open source is always better than proprietary, etc).
gui non-composable        ;; uu6255songe0rug ;; GUI-minded programs seldom lend themselves to being used as components in larger tools.
gui should be composable  ;; uu2719sile05pic ;; This means your program should be runnable both with and without the GUI present, and accept input from a mouse or under programmed control.
