## Partition array of lines into three segments, based on embedded content boundary

* **GOAL:** Partition an array of lines into segments, based on the position of a content boundary.
* The content boundary consists of two lines that contain some unique string that does not appear in any other line.
* In order to demonstrate how this is supposed to work, here are some "Before and After" images.

### Content boundary begins at line zero
